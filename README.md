## üîß Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js (v18+)** - [Download & Install](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git** - [Download & Install](https://git-scm.com/)
- **MongoDB** - [Download & Install](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
- **VS Code (or any code editor)** - [Download & Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Vite** (optional, included in dependencies)

---

## **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project from GitHub.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jahidhasan6676/tech-product-hunt-client.git

cd product-hunt-website
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

npm install
This will install all dependencies listed in package.json.

Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following configuration:

env
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
REACT_APP_MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
REACT_APP_JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
Replace your_firebase_api_key, your_mongodb_connection_string, your_jwt_secret, and your_stripe_public_key with your actual credentials.
Make sure your MongoDB instance is running.
Step 4: Start the Development Server
Run the following command to start the Vite development server:

npm run dev
By default, the frontend will be available at:

http://localhost:5173
If this port is already in use, Vite will automatically assign a different one.

Step 5: Run the Backend (if applicable)
If your project has a backend server, follow these steps:

Navigate to the backend folder:

cd server
Install backend dependencies:

npm install
Start the backend server:

npm run start
By default, the backend server will be available at:

http://localhost:5000
Step 6: Test the Project
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5173
Register or log in as a user.
Explore features like product submission, voting, and reviews.
Try different user roles (Normal User, Moderator, Admin).
Step 7: Build for Production
When you're ready to deploy, build the project using:

npm run build
This will generate optimized production files inside the dist folder.

Step 8: Troubleshooting
If you run into any issues, try the following:

Check your Node.js version: Run node -v (should be v18+).
Check MongoDB connection: Ensure MongoDB is running locally or your MongoDB Atlas URI is correct.
Clear npm cache (if packages fail to install):
sh
Copy
Edit
npm cache clean --force
Restart the development server after making changes to .env.
‚úÖ You're all set! Your Product Hunt Website should now be running locally. üöÄ
